## STL and `std::vector` containers

Start from the skeleton code provided in [cpp-stl/vector.cpp](vector.cpp) that will ask the user to input 10 numbers.

a) Introduce a `std::vector` container to store these numbers. Then modify the code such that the numbers provided by the user are appended to this container

b) Use `std::sort` function provided by `<algorithm>` to sort these numbers after they are given.

c) Use `std::min_element` and `std::max_element` from `<algorithm>` to find what is the smallest and largest element in the container.
