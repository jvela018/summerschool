## Datatypes and expressions

a) Simple arithmetic expressions. Perform simple expressions (additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions) with different type of variables (integers, floats, doubles) and print out results with `printf` (use correct format). Investigate also what happened in type conversions when combining different types. File [datatypes-expressions/expressions.c](expressions.c) contains a skeleton code to start with.

b) Using pointers. Add some pointer variables to the previous exercise assign them to addresses of existing variables. Perform simple expressions using both the original and pointer variables, and investigate their values after expressions. A skeleton code is provided in [datatypes-expressions/pointers.c](pointers.c).
