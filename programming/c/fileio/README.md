## File I/O ##

Implement a function that reads the initial temperature field from a file `bottle.dat`. The file contains a header line

    # ncols nrows

where `ncols` and `nrows` are integers that indicate the number of
columns and rows, respectively. The header line is followed by lines
representing the rows of the temperature field. A skeleton code is
provided in [read.c](read.c).
