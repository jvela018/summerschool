## Array intrinsic functions

Start from the dynamically allocatable array presented in Exercise 3
or from the skeleton code provided at
[intrinsics.F90](intrinsics.F90). Use suitable array intrinsic
functions to print out the following details:

a) What is the sum of elements across the 2nd dimension of A?

b) Find the location coordinates of the maximum elements of A.

c) What is the absolute minimum value of the array A?

d) Are all elements of A greater than or equal to zero?

e) How many elements of A are greater than or equal to 0.5?
