## Vector module

The file [vec.F90](vec.F90) contains a simple user
interface for a program that performs basic operations for vectors
given by the user (here 3D vectors for simplicity). Your task is to
implement operations for calculating the vector length (norm), as well
as summation, subtraction, dot product and vector (cross) product
between two vectors. Overload them to match with the syntax in
vec.F90. Placeholders for these in [vec_mod.F90](vec_mod.F90).
