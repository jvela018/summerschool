## Using the OpenMP library functions ##

Modify the Hello World program in [../hello-world/](../hello-world/)
so that it uses `omp_get_num_threads()` and `omp_get_thread_num()`
library functions and prints out the total number of active threads as
well as the ID of each thread. An example solution can be found in
[lib-funcs/](.).
